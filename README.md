- Given that 89.93% of missions were successful, it may be beneficial to analyse the common factors contributing to success. Identify best practices and lessons learned to enhance future mission success rates.
- Investigate the characteristics and features of rockets like RVSN USSR, CASC, and Arianespace that accounted for a significant number of missions. Consider adopting successful rocket models for upcoming space missions.
- Given that 78.21% of rockets are retired, assess the lifecycle and retirement patterns of these rockets. Plan for efficient rocket retirement strategies, considering factors such as technological advancements and mission requirements.
- Acknowledge the significant contributions from different countries. Explore opportunities for collaboration with countries like the USA, Russia, and Kazakhstan, which have been actively involved in space missions.
- Year 2021 recorded the highest number of missions, consider investing in emerging technologies and trends that contributed to this increase. Stay abreast of technological advancements for improved mission outcomes.
- Given that Cosmos-3M (11K65M) was the most used rocket type, explore the performance metrics and capabilities of this rocket. Consider its advantages for future missions and assess its compatibility with mission objectives.
